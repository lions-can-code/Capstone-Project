        <div>To find slope from an equation, you need to.... To find the slope from an equation, you need to rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where the coefficient of "x" (the "m" value) represents the slope; in other words, isolate "y" on one side of the equation to identify the slope as the number multiplied by "x".</div>
