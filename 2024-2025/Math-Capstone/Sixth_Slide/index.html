        <div><h1>How do you find slope from 2 coordinate pairs?</h1></div>
        <div>To find slope from coordinate pairs, you need to.... To find the slope from coordinate pairs, you need to subtract the y-coordinates of the two points and divide by the difference of their x-coordinates; this is represented by the formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two points on the line.</div>
