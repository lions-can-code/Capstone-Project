        <div>To find slope from a graph, you need to... To find the slope from a graph, you need to identify two points on the line, calculate the "rise" (change in y) between those points, then calculate the "run" (change in x), and finally divide the rise by the run; essentially, "rise over run" is the formula for slope.</div>
