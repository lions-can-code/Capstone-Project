        <div><h1>What is slope?</h1></div>
        <div class="big">Slope is... In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes the direction of the line on a plane. Often denoted by the letter m, slope is calculated as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change between two distinct points on the line, giving the same number for any choice of points.</div>
        <div class="big">Slope represents... The slope of a line represents how the y-axis values change compared to the numbers on the x-axis. This is also called the rate of change. We have also seen the following: The larger the slope = the steeper the line, or in other words, the greater the rate of change.</div>
        <div class="big">We use slope because... We use slope to measure the steepness of a line, essentially telling us how much a line rises or falls for every unit it moves horizontally, providing a way to quantify the rate of change between two points on a graph; it's a key concept in understanding the relationship between variables in various real-world situations like analyzing trends, building structures, or calculating the incline of a hill. </div>
